This doesnâ€™t mean that  \neach member is always holy. Jesus said there would be both good and bad members  \nin the Church (John 6:70), and not all the members would go to heaven (Matthew  \n7:21-23).  \nBut the Church itself is holy because it is the source of holiness and is the guardian  \nof the special means of grace Jesus established, the sacraments (cf.
